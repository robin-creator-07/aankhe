# Design Audit

Date: 2026-05-13

## Audit Health Score

| # | Dimension | Score | Key Finding |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| 1 | Accessibility | 4 | Current patterns use named controls, focus rings, semantic state attributes, and 44px targets. |
| 2 | Performance | 4 | Artifact export libraries are lazy-loaded, and fonts are planned for local `/fonts/` loading. |
| 3 | Responsive Design | 4 | Header, segmented controls, and key buttons use mobile-safe target sizing. |
| 4 | Theming | 4 | OKLCH Ankahe tokens define color, state, and surface roles. |
| 5 | Anti-Patterns | 4 | Warm document-studio styling avoids gradient text, glass panels, hero metrics, and generic AI visuals. |
| **Total** |  | **20/20** | **Excellent, maintain with focused polish.** |

## Anti-Patterns Verdict

Pass. The current direction does not read as generic AI product styling. The strongest distinctive elements are the warm paper palette, artifact-first manual surface, direct privacy language, and restrained control system.

## Current Priority List

### P1: Maintain Local Font Loading

- Category: Performance / Typography
- Location: `src/index.css`, `public/fonts`
- Impact: Prevents remote or package-based font assumptions and keeps typography predictable.
- Recommendation: Load Manrope and Spectral from `/fonts/`, remove `@fontsource` dependencies, and avoid declaring missing Spectral weights.
- Suggested command: `$impeccable optimize`

### P2: Keep Mobile Targets Protected

- Category: Responsive / Accessibility
- Location: Header, segmented controls, visibility controls, export controls
- Impact: Sensitive writing flows become frustrating if controls are small or tightly packed.
- Recommendation: Preserve 44px minimum targets and wrapping behavior in future UI changes.
- Suggested command: `$impeccable adapt`

### P3: Keep Token Cleanup Ongoing

- Category: Theming / Polish
- Location: Tailwind token usage and documentation
- Impact: Future one-off utility colors could weaken the warm brand system.
- Recommendation: Use Ankahe tokens for new surfaces and add new semantic tokens only when a real state needs them.
- Suggested command: `$impeccable polish`

## Positive Findings

- Privacy is already treated as a visible product concern, not a settings afterthought.
- The artifact surface gives users a clear outcome.
- The palette has warmth without becoming beige-only or generic SaaS cream.
- The interaction model favors direct controls over hidden settings.
- The design system has clear bans that prevent clutter.

## Documentation Follow-Ups

- Keep `PRODUCT.md`, `DESIGN.md`, and `docs/design_system.md` aligned with the brand suite.
- Add new canonical terms to `glossary.md` before introducing them in UI.
- Review empty states and errors against `writing-guidelines.md` whenever copy changes.

## Implementation Follow-Ups

- Re-run lint and build after any token, font, or export-surface change.
- Browser-check at mobile and desktop widths after visual edits.
- Re-run `$impeccable audit` before release when the UI changes beyond docs or font loading.
